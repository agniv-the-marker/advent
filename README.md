# Basic Review

I'm helping teach a friend how to code, and thought I would redo a bunch of python/rust solutions for [these](https://adventofcode.com/) along the way. Teaching him the basics of python/vscode/git!

## Qualms

I like using copilot for writing tests quickly, as it generally can figure out what's going on, and I like rust's ability to do tests just neatly at the bottom of the file. Other than that copilot seems kind of iffy â€” I think it's pretty good at converting between them but at times kind of janky.

Also, vscode just has a lot more helping things for rust! It can infer type immediately, you have nice buttons to run tests, etc. 

I love cargo :ferris:
