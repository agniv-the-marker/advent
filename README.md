# Basic Review

I'm helping teach a friend how to code, and thought I would redo a bunch of python/rust solutions for [these](https://adventofcode.com/) along the way. Teaching him the basics of python/vscode/git!

## Qualms

Note the way to execute the python ones are different. I'm writing it this way because that's what made sense to the friend to have every single one in it's own file, and I'm ok with this format. Rust has a `main.rs` which will run all of them instead, and I like this a little bit as well.

I like using copilot for writing tests quickly, as it generally can figure out what's going on, and I like rust's ability to do tests just neatly at the bottom of the file. Other than that copilot seems kind of iffy â€” I think it's pretty good at converting between them but at times kind of janky.

Also, vscode just has a lot more helping things for rust! It can infer type immediately, you have nice buttons to run tests, etc. 

I love cargo :ferris:
